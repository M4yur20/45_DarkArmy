        Apply direct pressure to the source of the bleeding with gauze or a cloth to stop the bleeding. If a bone has broken through the skin, cover the wound with loosely wrapped gauze or cloth. Don't increase damage by pressing directly on the bone or pushing it back into place. Put ice on the injured joint. This can help reduce swelling by controlling internal bleeding and the buildup of fluids in and around the injured joint.
